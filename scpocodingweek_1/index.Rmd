## Why R ?
R is a powerful, versatile and still improving programming language designed by and for daily data users.

--

It benefits from several keys components that make it incredibly handy :
* a deep and **easy-to-find documentation** ;
* a broad spectrum of **extensions and packages to fit any needs** (this presentation is entirely made in R) ;
* a huge **connectivity** with other techs and tools (APIs, other languages such as Python, SQL or Javascript, etc.) ;
* a **large and friendly community** ;
* and it's **open source**, come on !

--

And for your specific need as .red[**policy analysts**], using R instead of Excel or (worse) Numbers means :
* better tools ;
* easier to share ;
* simple to reproduce.

## You'll never be alone in R.

---
## Your new data hub : Rstudio
As other programming languages, R can be used in the command line (which we'll refer to as "cli" further on, for "command line interface").

But you'll benefit greatly from using a programming environnement.

The one we'll choose is Rstudio. It will help you :
* organize your files and data ;
* keep track of your environment (we'll get back to that later) ;
* solve most of common issues you'll encounter in an easier fashion.

--

Plus : it has MANY resources in [its cheatsheet page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

### But let's take a look around ourselves

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# 2 - The basics


---

## Data types

You'll stumble upon 3 main types of data in R (and in computers in general) :

.pull-left[1. **numeric values**, labeled "num" ;
2. **strings**, labeled "chr" for "character" ;
3. **boolean**, labeled "logi" for "logical".]

.pull-right[1. quantities : you can make math with ;
2. succession of character (can't do math with) ;
3. TRUE or FALSE (basically the answer to a closed question)]

--

To those mains types you'll use other values for specific cases :
* "NA", "#N/A" or "NaN", depending on the source, for "**not available**", describes a missing value in a dataset. **It's not "zero"** : it's a logical value that can be calculated (or evaluated) ;
* "NULL" is an undefined value. It can't be evaluated and, in most cases, can't be coherced into something else.

Other data types can be encountered in more advanced usage, such as geomatics ans statistics.

---

### Quick search : can you find 5 of each data type in the room ?

---

## R CLI basics

The "command line interface" or CLI is just a big supercharged calculator that can do many simple operations :
```{r}
1+1-12*24/2 # Basic arithmetic
42 %% 5 # Modulo
```

But it can also handle variables, meaning it can "store" values or data structures into a name and allow you to manipulate it. We'll say that we "assign" an object to a variable. In R, we do it with an arrow<sup>*</sup> :

```{r}
puregold <- (1+sqrt(5))/2
puregold
```

---

### Using functions

We talked earlier about **data types**. But how can we check the type of a specific data ?

Simple : you just need to put the data into a small program that performs the check for you. That's what we call a function and it works that way. Here, `typeof()` is **the function**, `3` **the argument** and `"double"` **the output** :

```{r}
typeof(3)
```

Some functions need a specific number of argument, some can use optional arguments and some need no argument. For example, `getcwd()` will tell you where you are in you filesystem without to provide further information to it.

Some functions will output a single data point, other series of data and some will perform an operation without outputing anything (being *silent* as we say).

There's pretty much a function for every routine task you may encounter.

---

## Data structures : vectors 1

Data can be stored in different type of structures, depending on your needs or the tools you use.

The **vector** is the core structure of R :
* it is one dimensional ;
* it is "atomic" (can contain only one type of data) ;
* it is indexable (you can call any value it contains by its index).

You can create a vector with the function `c()` with the values separated by commas :

```{r}
c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)
```


---

## Data structures : vectors 2

If you type it without any other command, it will vanish. To "store" it properly, you can "assign" it to a variable of your choice :

```{r}
lost <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42)
```

You can call any value with an index :

```{r}
lost[1]
```

**Warning** : for those used to other languages : indexing starts at 1 in R (contrary to Python for ex).

---

## Data structures : vectors 3

Data selection is essential to manipulate data : sorting, filtering, testing ... all of those operations rely on selection mecanism.

To select multiple values of a vector, you'll use brackets and put a vector inside of it to specify the sequence :
* with comma(s) if the values aren't consecutive ;
* with colon(s) if you're looking for a range.

```{r}
year <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")
year[c(1:4)]
year[c(1,6,10)]
```

### Yes : a vector within a vector

---

## Data structures : matrices

A matrix is a two dimensionnal data structure that can store one type of data.

You can create it with the function `matrix(values, [nrow=x, ncol=y])`. For exemple, to create a 4 by 5 matrix containing all value between 1 and 20 we'll go :

```{r}
matrix(1:20, nrow = 4)
```

You can coherce a vector into a matrix or a variable containing a certain number of values.

```{r}
matrix(lost, nrow=3)
```


---

## Data structures : data frames

The go-to structure for data manipulation will be dataframes, two dimensionnal data structures that can contain different data types for each column.

It's usually the data structure you'll end up with by loading an external fill. But you can make on youself by using the `data.frame()` function. To coherce several vectors together, for example.

```{r}
found <- c(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
data.frame(lost, found)
```



You'll work with a similar type called "tibbles" in a short time.

# 3 - The exploration

## Loading a dataset

From the outside, you can use : `read.csv()` for CSVs with the path to the file.

*Lazy tip : if you're not used to paths, you can store the path into a variable after choosing by with the function file.choose().*

For semi-colon separated values (or SCSV), you can use `read.csv2()`.

But you'll encounter many other formats to handle.
For text formats, we'll use `read.delim()`

You can also load data from within libraries (every single has one). But well'll get to that later.

Let's get into it with some ACTUAL data : [the list of the first names declared in the city of Bergerac](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/bergerac-listes-annuelles-des-prenoms-des-nouveaux-nes-declares-a-letat-civil/).

---


## What to do with it ?

We can poke around to know what's in our file.

First, we'll load it in our environment by assigning it to a variable :

```{r}
firstnames <- read.csv("../data/24037-etatcivil-prenoms-2018.csv")
```

### Beware of the accents!

You may encounter some special character that will be read in a strange way. In French, for example, accents may be replaced by series of non-sensical signs.

To be sure you can read all the signs is to specify the `encoding` as an argument of `read.csv()` as so :

```{r}

# for French accents, you can use "UTF-8" and sometimes "Latin-1" or "Latin1"
# test each to find the one that works best !

firstnames <- read.csv("../data/24037-etatcivil-prenoms-2018.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
```



---

## What to do with it ?


Let's do three basic stuff. Each time, we'll use the variable in which we stored the database as the only argument :
* check the name of the variables with `names()`
* look at the first rows with `head()`
* get a glimpse of the data with `summary()`

```{r}

names(firstnames) <- c("city_name","insee_code","child_gender","child_1stname","occurrences","year")

```


---

### Get an idea of the distribution

One of the most useful information we can gather from the start is **the distribution** of the data.

Meaning how the different values are spread across the database for each variable.

We can call the values for a specific variable by using `$` and adding the name of the variable. For example, we'll do `head(firstnames$ENFANT_PRENOM)` to see the first 6 first names in the database.

If we want to know how many time each value appears in the datasets for a specific variable, we'll use the function `table()` with the variable we want to study. For example :

```{r}
table(firstnames$child_gender)


```


---

### Let's make our first graph

.pull-left[
We'll stumble upon two types of variables :
* **continuous variables**, that can take any value in a range (hence, numeric) ;
* discontinuous or **discrete variables**, that only have a few possibilities (this is the case of some numeric and all character or logical variables).

When we have a continuous variable, we can study the distribution in a very effective way with a **histogram**. A histogram visualises the frequency of each value. We have only on continuous variable here, `NOMBRE_OCCURRENCES`.
]

.pull-right[
Here is a histogram of this variable :

```{r}
hist(firstnames$occurrences)
```

]

---

### Method : know what you manipulate

Before we go any further, we need to assess what every component of the dataset means in the real world (*IRL*). To stick to the data science typology, we'll use the following term to describe the elements of a dataset :

![](./img/dataset_structure.png)


In this case, what does each **observation** stands for ? What does each **variable** mean ? How were the **values** computed ?

.footnote[Source : [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), Hadley Whickam.]

---

## Let's call our first library

To make more of this dataset, we'll use a set of functions called **a library**. Most libraries are themed to fit specific tasks. In our case, we need tools to manipulate, wrangle and visualise the data. That's why we'll be installing **tidyverse**.

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```



---

### Side note : errors and warnings

You may have encountered some colored output loading the library. Especially some .red[red and scary ones].

--

Don't panic : it will take at least 5 minutes for the hackers to break into your computer.

--

Just kidding.

Those outputs may be of two kinds : warnings or errors. Let's explain :
* a **warning** is just way the program signals you that it did something without asking (cohercing a type into another, hidding some missing data, etc.) ;
* an **error** means that something was not done as you asked (couldn't make the caculation because of the type, couldn't find a file at the specified path, etc.).


---

### Side note : tests 1/2

A test is an operation designed to check a condition on a object. It outputs wether **TRUE** or **FALSE**. It can be performed in a limited number of ways :

```{r}
5 == 3 # strict equality
5 < 3 # strict inferiority
5 >= 3 # superior or equal
5 != 3 # opposite
```


---

### Side note : tests 2/2

In R, a test performed on a one dimensional data structure (vector, list, variable of a dataframe ...) output a vector of logical values. Each values being the result of the test for the value of the same index in the tested data structure.

This logical vector can be used to select values according to a condition.

Hence :
**Tests are the base of conditional selection.**

```{r}
firstnames$child_gender == "Masculin"
```


---

### Filter() : to focus on specific groups 1/2

`filter()` allows you to select observations based on a test. The arguments are :
1. the dataset ;
2. one or several tests.

You can select based on discrete values :
```{r}

dplyr::filter(firstnames, child_gender == "Masculin")

```


---

### Filter() : to focus on specific groups 2/2


You can select based on contiunous values :
```{r}
dplyr::filter(firstnames, occurrences > 3)
```

---

### Select() : to focus on specific variables 1/2

`select()` allows you to drop or keep variables from a dataset by listing their index or name.

There are two main advantages :
* a "narrower" dataset is easier to read ;
* a "lighter" dataset is faster to compute.

To choose what to drop, go for the fat, the redundant and the useless.

In the first nam dataset case, all observations have the same value for the city (*"Bergerac"*)* and, consequently, the same for the citycode. As we only use 2018 data, the value of year stays consistant across the dataset. Hence, expandable.

You can do the selection two ways : declaring what you keep or listing what you drop. Let's do this by quality first :

```{r}
dplyr::select(firstnames, child_gender, child_1stname, occurrences)
```


---

### Select() : to focus on specific variables 2/2

We can also do it by listing what we want to remove from the dataset and putting a minus sign in front of each.

You can do it variable by variable but it can be a little tidious and sloppy. To make it more readable and easy to handle, we can use a vector listing the name of the variables we want to get rid of. Then, to *"unselect"* them, we add them as the 2d argument for `select()` with an opening minus sign :

```{r}
letgo <- c("city_name","insee_code","year")

# to avoid a warning, we put our vector in the all_of() function :
# the result is the same as the previous one

f <- dplyr::select(firstnames, -all_of(letgo))
f
```


---

### Mutate() : to create the variables we need

`mutate()` is used to create extra variable we may need.

You can give it a fixed value but the most useful thing to do is assigning it an operation that will make an operation out of the other variables.

For example : we can 

```{r}

dplyr::mutate(f, share = occurrences/(sum(firstnames$occurrences))*100)

```


---

### %>% let's pipe it all together %>%

We most of the time perform operations in series : sampling, selecting variable, creating a variable, refiltering, etc.

To make it easier to combine those action without having to store intermediate results all the time, `tidyverse` allows you to chain them by using the `%>%` operator, or **pipe**. Put after a function, if "passes" the result on to the next function you add after it.

```{r}

# as we filter to keep only female first names, the child gender column becomes unrelevant
# we can pipe filter result to select to lighten our dataset

firstnames %>% filter(child_gender == "Féminin") %>% 
  select(child_1stname, occurrences)

# note here the tabulation at the beginning of the newline "indent" after the pipe
# it signals that the operation under is the continuation of the previous line

```


---

### Grouped summary

We often need to do calulation not at the scale of the whole dataset but for each value of a variable or combination of several variables. That's what the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions are designed for.

They work in pair :
1. you create groups by listing the relevant variable(s) as argument(s) of `group_by()` ;
2. then, you specify the name of a new calculated variable and the operation that will be applied to the groups you formed in `summarise()` (as you would do on the whole dataset with `mutate()`).

```{r}
firstnames %>% group_by(child_gender) %>% 
  summarise(g_max = max(occurrences), g_mean = mean(occurrences))

```
